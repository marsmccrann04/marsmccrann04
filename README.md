### Hi. Hello. I don't even know. ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 2nd year Computer Technology student who likes to make games, even though I suck at math. I also make websites at the most basic level, even though I suck at CSS styling. I also write short stories on my spare time, even though I procrastinate a lot. In short, I'm not the Matrix.

#### :computer: i program in: 
C#, Python, Java and JavaScript. Frameworks? I use Unity for games and I pretty much make programs with the console.

#### :floppy_disk: what projects am i planning to make on github?
I have already something planned, but I won't tell for now.

#### :godmode: any profiles other than github?
Gladly.
