### Hi. Hello. I don't even know. ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 2nd year Computer Technology student who likes to make games, even though I suck at math. I also make websites at the most basic level, even though I suck at CSS styling. I also write short stories on my spare time, even though I procrastinate a lot. In short, I'm not the Matrix.

#### I program in: 
C#, Python, Java and JavaScript
